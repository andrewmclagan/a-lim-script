# The Solution

### Installation

1. Simply clone the repository: 
2. Setup your hosts and server to point a `./public` directory.

**NOTE:** I did not have time for `.htaccess` rewrite rules so you must setup a domain e.g. `http://the-problem.app`.

##3 Why so much code for a small problem?

My assumption was this exercise is to demonstrate my knowledge in **software design patterns** and how to execute them in a real world problem. I developed a small micro MVC framework. There are some very obvious flaws with the current settup although I think it does demonstrate my abilities and basic understanding of the concepts involved.

Also I wanted to demostrate my ability to use modern development tools such as **git, package managers and task runners**.

Furthering this train of  through I demonstrated my ability as a **full-stack** developer implimenting the frontend in **AngularJS*.
