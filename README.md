# The Solution

if you have trouble installing view [http://the-problem.andrewmclagan.com/](http://the-problem.andrewmclagan.com/)

### Installation

1. Simply clone this repository.
2. Setup your hosts and server to point a `./public` directory.

**NOTE:** I did not have time for `.htaccess` rewrite rules so you must setup a domain e.g. `http://the-problem.app` pointing to the `./public` directory as root.

## Why so much code for a small problem?

The problem could have been solved quite fast with two of the core classes in this repo `TheProblem\Parser\DataParser` and `TheProblem\Parser\DateParser`. Although...

I assumed this exercise was to demonstrate knowledge of **software design patterns** and their implementation. I developed a small, fast and dirty micro MVC framework to demonstrate some of these basic patterns and principles. Also demonstrating abilities with development tools such as **git, package managers and task runners**. Furthering this train of thought by demonstrating my ability as a **full-stack** developer implementing the front-end in **AngularJS**.
